9.2 Disciplinary measures \
Disciplinary measures may be imposed whenever there is a finding ...\
\
A: Based on the provided HR policy context, here's what I can share about an employee's rights and financial \
consequences in cases of gross misconduct:\
\
**Rights During the Process:**\
\
1. **Investigation with Full Pay**: In cases of serious offences, staff members shall be suspended with **full pay** \
until the investigation is completed.\
\
2. **Right to Explain**: Staff members must be given a chance to explain their side of the story before any \
disciplinary action is taken.\
\
3. **Full Investigation**: No action will be taken until the investigation is completed. The procedures allow for full\
investigation of an offence.\
\
**Financial Consequences Upon Summary Dismissal:**\
\
Staff members who are subject to summary dismissal shall **NOT** be entitled to:\
- Pay in lieu of notice\
- Severance pay\
\
**Additional Context:**\
\
The policy indicates that gross misconduct (which includes offences like fraud, embezzlement, or misappropriation of \
GESCI's funds) is liable to summary or "instant" dismissal. The procedure followed is similar to regular disciplinary \
procedures, except that the outcome is summary dismissal instead of a final written warning.\
\
This information covers the key aspects mentioned in the policy documents regarding rights during the process and \
financial consequences of summary dismissal for gross misconduct.\

This is a clear and comprehensive prohibition that covers:\

\
A: Based on the HR policy documents, here is GESCI's policy on working from home:\
\
**Working from Home Policy:**\
\
1. **Arrangement Types**: Staff members may work from home either at GESCI's request or at the staff member's request \
with GESCI's consent.\
\
2. **Health and Safety Coverage**: When working from home, the home is regarded as a location of work that falls under\
the scope of OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Act). All health and safety policies that apply to office-based \
staff also apply to home-workers.\
\
3. **Inspection Rights**: GESCI reserves the right to inspect any home-working environment. Authorized occupational \
safety and health officers are entitled to visit home-based offices to ensure compliance with safety requirements.\
\
4. **Continuation Requirements**: If any health and safety issues arise in the home-working environment, these must be\
resolved to GESCI's satisfaction for the home-working arrangement to continue.\
\
5. **Flexible Hours**: The policy also mentions that flexible working hours can be agreed between staff and line \
managers, taking into account both individual and organizational needs. Such arrangements within programme/project \
teams need to be cleared by the CEO.\
\
The policy emphasizes that health, safety, and compliance standards are maintained regardless of work location.\
