SECTION 3: DISCIPLINARY PROCESS
============================================================

3.1 Overview
ACME Corp follows a progressive disciplinary structure designed to
support employee improvement while maintaining organizational standards.

3.2 Escalation Steps
The disciplinary process follows these escalation steps:
  Step 1 — Verbal Warning: The manager documents the issue and delivers
           a verbal warning. The conversation is noted in the employee's file.
  Step 2 — Written Warning: A formal written warning is issued, signed by
           both the manager and the employee, and filed with HR.
  Step 3 — Performance Improvement Plan (PIP): A structured 30/60/90-day
           plan with measurable goals is created in collaboration with HR.
  Step 4 — Final Written Warning: If the PIP objectives are not met, a
           final written warning is issued. This is the last step before
           termination is considered.

3.3 Termination
Termination may occur after Step 4 or immediately in cases of gross
misconduct (e.g., theft, harassment, or violation of safety protocols).
All termination decisions require HR and Legal review.

3.4 Documentation
Each step must be documented by HR and acknowledged (signed) by the employee.
Refusal to sign does not prevent the process from advancing.
